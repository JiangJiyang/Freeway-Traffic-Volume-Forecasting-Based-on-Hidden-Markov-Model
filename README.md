# Freeway-Traffic-Volume-Forecasting-Based-on-Hidden-Markov-Model
Our project is a hidden Markov model to forecast the freeway traffic volume, we collected the sectional traffic data of 26 freeways in Jiangsu province and analysed its digital characteristics to forecast the traffic volume in the future months accurately. Actually, our model is the combination of Markov model and Renewal model. In the experiment, you can forecast the freeways in batch with HMM by Markov_batch_processing.py,and the comparison model is GM in gray_batch_processing.py. You can forecast the traffic volume for a certain month by Markov_predict.py.
